- Voice clarity assessment
- Volume analysis
- Pronunciation evaluation
- Voice stability check
- Visual analysis (waveform, spectrogram)

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

1. Install requirements:
```bash
pip install numpy librosa matplotlib IPython
```

2. Run analysis:
```python
from voice_analyzer import VoiceAnalyzer
analyzer = VoiceAnalyzer()
result = analyzer.analyze_voice_file('audio.wav')
```

## ðŸ“‹ Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- numpy
- librosa
- matplotlib
- IPython

## ðŸ’¡ Usage Example
